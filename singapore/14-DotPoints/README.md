# DotPoints
## Introduction
DotPoins is a chain built for taking loyalty programs to the next level. It creates a unified ecosystem for loyalty points by leveraging Polkadot's multichain messaging, thereby generating a liquid economy. The platform is targeted at companies seeking to generate revenue through their loyalty programs. To achieve this, DotPoints introduces a staking and liquidity pool (LP)-like mechanism as a core part of its tokenomics. 

We propose to solve a two-dimensional problem: companies often exchange money for customer loyalty, and users lack a unified platform to keep track of all their loyalty points. The former results in financial costs for companies, while the latter creates a poor user experience. 

Our solution is straightforward: Dotpoints creates a mechanism where companies can safely earn interest on cash allocated to loyalty programs, while users benefit from a robust, unified ecosystem for managing their points. This is made possible by leveraging Polkadotâ€™s multichain focus and its validators, which have exceptionally low slashing rates.
## Features planned for the Hackathon
 - [ ] Build a parachain on Substrate.
 - [ ] Propose staking/liquidity pool (LP) mechanisms for DotPoints.
 - [ ] Create a contract for minting company-specific ERC-20 tokens.
 - [ ] Propose a fee system to enable a hedge-like protocol and generate revenue for DotPoints.
 - [ ] Create a contract for reward/cash redemption for company-token holders.
 - [ ] Integrate our DeFi branch (staking/LP) with Acala for auto bridge-stake and auto bridge-LP.
 - [ ] Create a UI/UX to onboard partner companies and streamline the loyalty program launch process.
 - [ ] Create a UI/UX for users to track their tokens and interact with the Polkadot ecosystem (bridging, trading, etc.)
